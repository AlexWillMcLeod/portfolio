# Portfolio Website - Alex McLeod

Responsive portfolio website developed using a modern component based architecture with SolidJS and Vite as a build tool. Features various sections for, about me, projects, experience, and academic results, as well as links, and a contact page. Website, originally developed by @alexwillmcleod, can easily be forked and customised for anyone by re-using components and updating attributes for users.

Note: Contact page does not function.
